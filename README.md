# Bankers - Windows Forms C# Project

Bankers is a Windows Forms C# project that simulates the Banker's algorithm for resource allocation. It allows users to input the available resources and the resource needs of different processes, and then determines if a safe sequence exists.

## Features
* GUI-based interface for ease of use
* Calculation of the need matrix and allocation matrix
* Detection of a safe request if it exists
* Display of results in a user-friendly manner

## Background
The background is currently a repetitive portrait of my professor and role model [Sherrif Fadel]([url](https://www.sheriffadelfahmy.org/)) 
for humorous purposes and by **ZERO** means does it mean mockery or belittlement. 
In contrast, its pure purpose is to give him a good laugh about it.
